This project implements a simple graphical user interface (GUI) on an ESP32 microcontroller using the LVGL library, interfaced with an NV3041A display (480x272 resolution) via a QSPI bus and an XPT2046 touchscreen controller via HSPI. The GUI features a centered button labeled "Hello!" and a counter label at the top. When the button is touched, the counter increments, and the updated count is displayed on the screen and printed to the serial monitor. The code integrates display and touch drivers, handles touch calibration, and uses a framebuffer for smooth rendering, providing a responsive and interactive UI for embedded applications.
